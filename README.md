# MultithreadedTC

A port of [MultithreadedTC](https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/multithreadedtc/) to junit5.

The code here is derived from the MultithreadedTC-1.01 source distribution.
Most of the thread management capability has been carried over to a junit5 context.
Usage examples can be found in the 'test' directory.
